# LitesiteJS

## Introduction
LitesiteJS is a lightweight CMS engine coded in pure JS. Runs entirely client-side, requires no backend setup or database. Can be hosted pretty much anywhere.

Why?

* It was fun to create
* Also, why not?

Obvious downsides are obvious: you have to edit the server-side files to change the content and data is publicly available for scraping.

## Features

Some of functionalities that LitesiteJS provides:
* Listing and displaying posts
* Filtering posts by tags and categories
* Custom top menu page structure
* Markdown parsing

## Contributing

Make sure you follow these rules when contributing changes to this project:

1. **Don't**

This isn't a case of hubris. Quite opposite. As I'm writing this, in the early stages of Litesite development, I'm very inept at Javascript. This is a solo project I intend to learn JS with and enjoy every bit of it.

**But** while I don't want anyone else to contribute code to the repository, if anyone wishes to contribute bug findings or suggestions, [Issues](https://github.com/turowski-k/litesitejs/issues) is the way to go about it. Open one, tag it properly and describe your findings.

I will appreciate **greatly** any insights on improving the app.

At the same time, please remember that some of the stuff is coded in a way that might not make sense for one of two reasons. Firstly, I am inexperienced and willing to improve on it. Secondly, I might've included something that didn't make sense, because I wanted to learn something by coding it.
